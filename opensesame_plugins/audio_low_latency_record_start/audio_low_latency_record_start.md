OpenSesame Plug-in: Audio Low Latency
==========

*An OpenSesame Plug-in for playing and recording audio files with low latency on Linux.*

1. About
--------

The main goal of this plug-in is to play and record audio with minimal and predictable latencies to achieve a high accuracy and precision. The 'PyAlsaAudio' package which uses the Linux ALSA audio system provided the best results within Python. 
For compatibility reasons the 'PortAudio' and 'sounddevice' options were added so experiments can be created and fully executed on Windows systems. 'PortAudio' and 'sounddevice' are cross-platform and work on both Windows as Linux but these give a higher and more variable latency than the 'alsaaudio' option.
To fully utilize this plug-in you need a Linux system with ALSA and the 'PyAlsaAudio' package (version 0.8.4 or higher). In Debian and Ubuntu this package is named python3-pyalsaaudio. The Python package is also available on pypi and the source on github:

The plug-in has an *init* item which should be placed at the beginning of an experiment:

**Note:** this is a multi-threaded background item, it will immediately advance to the next item, it will **NOT** wait for the recording to finish.

Audio Low Latency Record Start parameters:

- *Audio Filename* path to the audio file.
- *Duration* in ms, or string 'infinite'.
- *Delay* in ms.
- *Pause/Resume* list of buttons separated by ';'
- *Stop* list of buttons separated by ';'
- *Cache to RAM* file will be cached to RAM before saving.
