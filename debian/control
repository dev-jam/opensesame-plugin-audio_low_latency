Description: An OpenSesame plug-in for playing and recording audio files with low latency
 The main goal of this plug-in is to play and record audio with minimal and predictable
 latencies to achieve a high accuracy and precision. The PyAlsaAudio package which uses
 the Linux ALSA audio system provided the best results within Python. PortAudio
 and sounddevice are cross-platform and work on both Windows as Linux.
